I've worked as writer in politics and marketing in Texas, a global events organizer in various countries in Asia, France and Switzerland, and now, I'm a student all over again, currently working on a [Master's in Applied Economics at the Université de Neuchâtel](https://www.unine.ch/mscapec/home.html).

I'm interested in economics and migration, the future of work and social protection, and data science.

Back when I used to have free time, I was an avid reader of contemporary fiction and was often at my happiest on a road bike, rolling through Swiss country side.

The blog--along with everything else--is a work in progress.

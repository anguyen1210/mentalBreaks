*$H_0:$ You can't teach an old dog new tricks.*

I've worked as a writer in Texas, a global events organizer in  Switzerland, and now, on the wrong side of 40, I'm a student all over again, excited to see what's next.

I'm interested in economics and migration, the future of work, and data science.

Back when I used to have free time, I was an avid reader of news and contemporary fiction, and was often at my happiest on a road bike, rolling through Swiss country side.

The blog--along with everything else--is a work in progress.

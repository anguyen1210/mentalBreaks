I’ve worked as a political reporter and tech marketer in Texas, a project manager in the international development community putting together conferences on global health and development issues on on five of the seven continents, and now, after retraining myself in all-things data-science and going back for a degree in Economics, I find myself working in the heart of the global COVID-19 response.

My happy place is a weekend morning with a fresh cup of coffee and newspaper spread out on the table in front of me, or if I have more time, on a long bike ride through the Swiss countryside where I live now.

The blog–along with everything else–is a work in progress.

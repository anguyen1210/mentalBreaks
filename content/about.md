I’ve worked as a political reporter and tech marketer in Texas, a global events organizer in various countries in Asia, France and Switzerland, and now, I’m a student all over again, currently finishing up a Master’s in Applied Economics at the Université de Neuchâtel.

I'm interested in migrants, minorities, the intersection between the future of work and social protection, and everything data science.

Back when I used to have free time, I was an avid reader of contemporary fiction and was often at my happiest on a road bike, rolling through Swiss country side.

The blog–along with everything else–is a work in progress.

Still road testing this blog. Looking to launch this soon for 2019!  
  
Right now, some ideas are to use this blog to share some data-related projects and analysis I've done for work and/or school.  

Otherwise, maybe I can use this blog to start exploring a particular topic in depth (refugee stats, integration, social policy?).   

Or finally, I'm thinking about using it to discuss going back to school and the career change journey.

This [COVID-19 Tracker Shiny app](https://mentalbreaks.shinyapps.io/covid19/) aims to allow easy comparison between countries using the data provided by the [Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).    
  
Data used in the app will be updated daily. Additional features and edits will be added on an ongoing basis. Feedback or comments are welcome. Feel free to send me an email or leave your comments directly on the [COVID-19 tracker post](https://mentalbreaks.rbind.io/posts/covid-19-tracker/).

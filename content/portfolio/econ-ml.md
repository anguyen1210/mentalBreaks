This page contains a collection of some of my favorite resources covering the intersection between the fields of Economics and Machine Learning. By no means comprehensive, this collection of readings, videos, online courses, syllabi and miscellaneous links reflect my own interests in the application of machine learning approaches to social problems traditionally of interest to economists, and is aimed at early students interested in learning more about machine learning and how to integrate machine learning approaches to the field of applied economics. Suggestions, constructive comments and friendly inquiries are welcome.

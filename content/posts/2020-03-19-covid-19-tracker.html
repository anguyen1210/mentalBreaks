<p>There’s no shortage of dashboards and data-visualizations covering some aspect of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but not having come across a tool that allowed me to easily compare countries myself, I developed this COVID-19 Tracker shiny app both for my own personal use, as well as to get some more experience working Shiny.</p>
<p>This app was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1237737352879112194">a vizualization produced by John Burn-Murdoch for the Financial Times</a> that I thought did a very nice job at allowing cross-country comparisons of the trajectories of the total confirmed cases by standardizing countries using the “Number of days since the 100th case” on the x-axis.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the widely referenced <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">JHU-CSSE dashboard</a> does not allow for an easy way to select countries for direct comparison, though given that they’ve made their data available on Github, it was simple enough to design a Shiny app that allows the user to select different countries of interest and standardize them to <em>days since the N-th</em> case for comparison.</p>
<p>Currently, a maximum of six countries can be compared at a time. The limit was set simply to allow for better readability of the resulting plots. Users can select between <em>total confirmed cases</em>, <em>deaths</em>, and <em>total recovered</em> as the different y-axis outcome variables.</p>
<p>The default <em>N</em> number for the total confirmed cases outcome is set to 100, in keeping with the most widely used convention at the moment. For <em>deaths</em>, <em>N</em>=10 can be used.</p>
<p>There are a few countries that include more detailed regional breakdowns of the data. Where this is the case, the totals for those countries are given by the country name + “<em>(all territories)</em>”.</p>
<p>Data used in the app will be updated daily. Additional features and edits will be added on an ongoing basis. Feedback or comments are welcome.</p>

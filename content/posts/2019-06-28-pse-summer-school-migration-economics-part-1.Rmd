# Summer school and migration economics
  
Classes are finally over for the semester, and the summer break means I have a bit of extra personal time for all of the little events and projects I've been planning for over the past year. At the top of the list is one of two summer courses I've signed up for: [Migration Economics at the Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/pse-summer-school/migration-economics/).  
  
I was looking at a few different summer school options, and what sold me on this particular course, was the very [detailed agenda and reading list that they published online](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/IMG/pdf/migration-economics-sumschool-pse-2019.pdf). I'm not aware of any comparable program in Europe that would give me such a wide exposure to different areas of migration economics research within such a short time frame, and in this respect, I was very happy with the course.  
 
The course was divded into four parts.

# Migration and 

The first part of the course (taught by David McKenzie) addresses the challenge of identifying the microeconomic impacts of migration. It discusses the various channels through which migration has a measurable impact on the migrant household, the key obstacles to being able to attribute effects to migration itself, and different empirical methods that can be used to identify the impacts of migration.
The second part (taught by Hillel Rapoport) studies the relationship between globalization and development. It analyzes how migration affects other dimensions of globalization, such as trade, FDI, technology diffusion and the transmission of socio-cultural norms.

 terms of methodology, the course combines theoretical modeling in the migration literature with the most recent and rigorous empirical evidence.

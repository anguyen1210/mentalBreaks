The Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS) data is available to researchers by request, where each year's data is provided as a large CSV file along with two additional sets of variable and value label files that have been exported from SAS and SPSS into TXT format. For those wishing to work with these label files in R, I introduce a few custom functions that transform the supplied label files into named objects that play nicely with the tidyverse [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) and [labelled](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) packages.
  
## Background  
  
The Swiss Federal Statistics office (OFS) has conducted the [Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS)](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/work-income/surveys/slfs.html) since 1991 to gather representative data on the socio-economic structure of the country's permanent resident population and their participation in the labor force. It's based on a representative sample of the population, from which  approximately 120,000 interviews are conducted annually. Prior to 2010 the phone based interviews (CATI) that make up the survey were all conducted in the second quarter of each year, but since that time, the interviews have been spread out to take place over the course of the entire year. The survey is fully compliant with international standards, covers the entire spectrum of standard labor market indicators, and includes a rotating set of thematic modules to investigate special topics of interest each year. For more details, just consult the French or German versions of [the website](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/statistiques/travail-remuneration/enquetes/espa.html), as the documentation is quite comprehensive.  
  
With regards to the survey data files themselves, the organization and naming conventions used for the main CSV files are consistent over the years, with the one major change happening in 2010, where in addition to the annual data files, quarterly file subsets were included to reflect the change in the data collection process. 

The variable names and values in the TXT label files, however, show a bit more variation over time, so care should be taken to ensure that variable names and value label categories are consistent when putting together longitudinal panels using this data. Firstly, not all years have the same number of variables. For example, the files for the 1996 SLFS only capture a low of 507 different variables, while in 2006 there were up to 816 different variables measured (median across all years is 654).   
    
Secondly, while most of the main variable names remain unchanged throughout the years, a few variable names are edited slightly to reflect updated methodologies or coding schemes. Just to name a few examples, the variable that records the commune of the respondent changes from `B019` to `B019P` in 1999, or the variable that captures the different age groups off the respondents changes from `AGE` to `AGE64` in 2001. 

There are also cases where the variable names do not change at all, but the value labels used by the variables change as coding schemes are updated. One of the more notable examples is for the variable `IS05` that records the national origin of the survey respondent. In 1996, the values of this variable changed from the old, 2-digit system where only 50 countries are captured, to the 4-digit system that captures the 200+ recognized country names currently used by the national statistical office today. 

## Importing the data with `read_slfs`  
  
To work with the Swiss Labor Force Survey in R, I introduce three custom functions designed to read in the SLFS data (`read_slfs`), the variable label files (`read_slfs_var`) and the value label files (`read_slfs_val`) that are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/anguyen1210/slfs-tools). All three depend on a number of other functions from the readr, stringr, tidyr, magrittr, tibble and labelled packages. Those packages can be called up individually, or more conveniently, by just loading the `tidyverse` package along with the `labelled` package. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(labelled)
```
  
The `read_slfs` functions, themselves, can be downloaded directly from R by entering the  following:  
```{r}
#install.packages(devtools)

devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anguyen1210/slfs-tools/main/R/read_slfs.R")
```
  
## Working with single year files  
  
### The main data CSV file

The simplest case is reading in a single year of the SLFS data. As there is only a single data file, in CSV format, with a consistent naming convention for all years of the SLFS, this is straight-forward and can be done easily with the functions provided in base R or the readr package. Where the `read_slfs` function is different is that it can take up to 3 inputs: the SLFS data file, the variable label file and the value label file. If the respective label files are not included in the the `read_slfs` call, then the function just defaults to a simple `readr::read_delim` call.  
      
In other words, the following two statements are equivalent when there are no other inputs:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
read_slfs("data/SAKE1991.csv")

read_delim("data/SAKE1991.csv")  
```
    
Before we see what happens when we try to read in everything at once, let's first examine the two different label files that are included in these datasets.  
    
### The variable label files
  
The label files that are included with the SLFS data is where the bulk of the work needs to be done in order to use them in R. For each year of the SLFS, there are four sets of two label files provided--each set contains a variable label file and a value label file; with different sets for French and German labels, and different sets that are exported from SAS or from SPSS. These label files are available as simple TXT files, which is where the challenge lies.  
    
While the haven package provides easy tools for reading in and working with SAS and SPSS files saved in their native formats (`.sas7bdat` and `.sav` files, respectively), the TXT exports of the respective label files have irregular formats that do not work with haven, nor with standard base R or readr functions. 
  
![SAS- and SPSS-format variable label TXT files provided in the SLFS](/posts/2020-11-09-swiss-labour-force-survey-working-with-labeled-data-in-r_files/varlab_comparison.png){width=700px}  
  
Above we see the identical French variable label file in SAS format (on the left) vs. the SPSS version (on the right). The differences are minor--the SAS and SPSS version use different delimiters; the SPSS version has an extra offset line at the top and bottom of the file that must be accounted for.    

`read_slfs_var` imports the respective label files and creates named character vectors that can then be fed into the different functions from the `labelled` package. `read_slfs_var` is indifferent to whether or not the SAS version or the SPSS version is provided as an input.  
  
For example, the following imports of the variable label files for this year of the SLFS are equivalent:  
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
varlab2019_sas <- read_slfs_var("D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F-SAS.TXT")

varlab2019_spss <- read_slfs_var("D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F-SPSS.TXT")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
varlab2019_sas <- read_slfs_var("data/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F.SAS.TXT")

varlab2019_spss <- read_slfs_var("data/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F.SPSS.TXT")
```

This is confirmed below, where we can see that the output using either input file is an identical named character vector:
```{r}
glimpse(varlab2019_sas)
glimpse(varlab2019_sas)
```
```{r}
sum(varlab2019_sas == varlab2019_spss)
```
    
### The value label files  
  
With regards to the the SLFS value label files, while the SAS and SPSS versions are a bit more irregular then the corresponding variable label file, the `read_slfs_val` function also handles either one similarly and outputs an identical named list that can be used by the `labelled` package functions.
  
![SAS- and SPSS-format value label TXT files](/posts/2020-11-09-swiss-labour-force-survey-working-with-labeled-data-in-r_files/valuelab_comparison.png){width=700px}
  
In this image above, we can see that there are a number of different little things that can trip up our import of these files, including the extra characters added to the SAS variables, the different delimiter scheme for the values in the SAS version, the added top and bottom line on the SPSS file. Regardless, we can read in either file the same was as before with `read_slfs_val`.      
  
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
valuelab019_sas <- read_slfs_val("D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-FORMAT-F-SAS.TXT")

valuelab2019_spss <- read_slfs_val("D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-VALUE-LABEL-F-SPSS.TXT")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
valuelab019_sas <- read_slfs_val("data/S2019-FORMAT-F-SAS.TXT")

valuelab019_spss <- read_slfs_val("data/S2019-VALUE-LABEL-F-SPSS.TXT")
```

As before, the output of `read_slfs_val` is identical regardless of whether the SAS or SPPS TXT file is used as an input. The difference here, however, is instead of a named character vector, the value label file is converted into a named list as we can see below.

### Working with the label files in R
   
The main benefit of using `read_slfs_var` and `read_slfs_val` is to easily import the supplied SLFS variable and value label files into a format that is compatible with the different tools provided in the `labelled` package. With the main data file read in, along with its corresponding label files, the `labelled` package allows you to apply the labels to the data, sort the various labels and values, quickly reference label values, convert the labels to factors for use in plots, and any other number of useful functions. Please refer to the [`labelled` documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/index.html) and [vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) for more details of the different ways to work with these label files in R.  
  
While it is possible to read in all of the label files in at the same time as the data file with the `read_slfs` function (as detailed below), I found it useful to have these label files imported as separate objects when I needed to quickly relabel subsetted data that had lost the initial labeling, or when I was in the process of doing a thorough analysis on the variables I had selected for analysis to see if and how they had changed over time.
    
### Putting it all together  

As I've already alluded to, it is possible to import the main data file and label all the variables and values at one time by supplying all three files (data, variable label and value label--in that order) to `read_slfs` at the same time. 
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# slfs2019 <- read_slfs("D:/sake/SAKE2019.csv",
#                       "D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F-SAS.TXT",
#                       "D:/sake/SAKE2019_Metadata/S2019-FORMAT-F-SAS.TXT")
# saveRDS(slfs2019, "D:/sake_rds/slfs2019.rds")

slfs2019 <- readRDS("D:/sake_rds/slfs2019.rds")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
slfs2019 <- read_slfs("data/SAKE1991.csv", 
                      "data/S2019-VAR-LABEL-F.SAS.TXT", 
                      "data/S2019-FORMAT-F-SAS.TXT"
                      )
```
  
```{r}
slfs2019 %>% select(1:10) %>% glimpse()
```
Above, I show the first 10 columns of our imported data, where we can see that our data has fully labeled variables, as evidenced by the `<dbl + lbl>` class. Here, our data is ready to be used with the different helper functions provided in the `labelled` package.   
  
For example, we can quickly check a variable label by entering the following:
```{r}
var_label(slfs2019$B0000)
```
Or supposing we see one of the observations in this column has a particular value, we can find the specific associated value label by entering:
```{r}
val_label(slfs2019$B0000, 4)
```
  
Or perhaps, we just want to quickly see the labels for all of the values of this variable, we can simply call:
```{r}
val_labels(slfs2019$B0000)
```
  
As previously mentioned, there's a lot you can do with the `labelled` package. Have a look at the ["Introduction to labelled" vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) to get quickly up to speed.
  
## Importing multiple years  
  
In this section, I demonstrate a quick solution to reading in multiple years of SLFS data and labeling everything at once, taking advantage of both `read_slfs` and `purr`.
  
Let's say we want to load the last 10 years of SLFS data, and we uncompress all of the data we receive from the OFS so that the CSV files and their corresponding metadata subfolders all sit in the same folder ("/data") as shown here:  
  
<center>  
![](/posts/2020-11-09-swiss-labour-force-survey-working-with-labeled-data-in-r_files/file_folder.png){width=600px}  
</center>    

As we noted from before, the basic organization and naming conventions of the files are consistent over the years, and here we can see that the the file names are all identical apart from the year of the survey. With that said, we can quickly create a list for the different files that we want to read in, and then iterate over those lists to import all 10 years of the survey at once.    
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# create lists of filenames
years <- seq(2010, 2019) 

list_data <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                    function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], ".CSV"))

list_varlabs <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                       function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], "_Metadata/S", years[x], "-VAR-LABEL-F-SAS.txt"))


list_valuelabs <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                           function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], "_Metadata/S", years[x], "-FORMAT-F-SAS.txt"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# create lists of filenames
years <- seq(2010, 2019) 

list_data <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                    function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], ".CSV"))

list_varlabs <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                       function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], "_Metadata/S", years[x], "-VAR-LABEL-F-SAS.txt"))


list_valuelabs <- sapply(seq_along(years), 
                           function(x) paste0("D:/sake/SAKE", years[x], "_Metadata/S", years[x], "-FORMAT-F-SAS.txt"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# read in data and label all variables and values at once, name the different
# data sets in the list
slfs2010_2019 <- pmap(list(list_data, list_varlabs, list_valuelabs), read_slfs)

data_names <- sapply(1:length(years), function(x) paste0("sake", years[x]))

names(slfs2010_2019) <- data_names
```
  
The result is a list with all of the labeled datasets that we can easily work with, or collapse to one large dataframe with a simple `bind_rows()` call when ready.

There's no shortage of dashboards and data-visualizations covering some aspect of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but not having come across a tool that allowed me to easily compare countries myself, I developed this [COVID-19 Tracker shiny app](https://mentalbreaks.shinyapps.io/covid19/) both for my own personal use, as well as to get some more experience working with Shiny.

This app was inspired by [a vizualization produced by John Burn-Murdoch for the Financial Times](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1237737352879112194) that I thought did a very nice job at allowing cross-country comparisons of the trajectories of the total confirmed cases by standardizing countries using the "Number of days since the 100th case" on the x-axis.

At the time of writing, the widely referenced [JHU-CSSE dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) does not allow for an easy way to select countries for direct comparison, though given that they've made their data available on Github, it was simple enough to design a Shiny app that allows the user to select different countries of interest and standardize them to *days since the N-th* case for comparison.

Currently, a maximum of six countries can be compared at a time. The limit was set simply to allow for better readability of the resulting plots. Users can select between *total confirmed cases*, *deaths*, and *total recovered* as the different y-axis outcome variables. 

The default *N* number for the total confirmed cases outcome is set to 100, in keeping with the most widely used convention at the moment. For *deaths*, *N*=10 can be used.  
 
There are a few countries that include more detailed regional breakdowns of the data. Where this is the case, the totals for those countries are given by the country name + "*(all territories)*".

Data used in the app will be updated daily. Additional features and edits will be added on an ongoing basis. Feedback or comments are welcome.

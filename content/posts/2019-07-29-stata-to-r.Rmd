R was the first statistical software package I learned, and I still prefer it to everything else, despite Stata being both easier to use as well as [the dominant software package for economists](https://mentalbreaks.rbind.io/posts/economics-journals-and-software/).

Inspired by my classes at [UNINE](https://www.unine.ch/unine/en/home.html), as well as all of the great [cheatsheets on the Rstudio site](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), I tried to capture some of the more common Stata commands used in an applied econometrics and their equivalent expressions in R in this [Stata to R cheatsheet](https://github.com/anguyen1210/stata2r).     
  
This cheatsheet assumes a basic familiarity with R--how to read in files, install and load packages, and work with dataframes. I went back and forth on whether to use or include Tidyverse commands, but despite some very good arguments that [the Tidyverse offers an easier approach to R for beginners](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/), based on my own experience so far within the Economics department at my own university, most of the classes that use R are introducing it to students for the first time, and only introduce various Tidyverse functions on a piecemeal basis without context of the suite of packages and their approach to doing things. With that said, in order to make this cheatsheet as useful to the broadest range of R beginners, I've tried to use base R whenever possible. Those proficient with the Tidyverse will undoubtedly be able to adapt any of the solutions I provided here in any case.

With regards to packages, one of the advantages of R is that there's pretty much a package for *every* task you would want to do, but I've tried to minimize solutions that require specific packages to keep as many of the solutions "straight out of the box" as possible. When there really was no simple way to do things (e.g. calculating robust standard errors), I just picked the package that I knew of that best replicated the simplicity of the Stata solution.
    
Lastly, it should be noted that it's impossible to cover everything in two pages, so this meant to be a "survival" level cheat sheet--a handy reference for the core commands you would need to replicate a while doing a basic econometric analysis in Stata. 
      
The content is biased towards my own experience, but if this cheat sheet is at all helpful to others, I would love to hear your feedback, which will help tremendously with future updates.   

All comments and suggestions are welcome!

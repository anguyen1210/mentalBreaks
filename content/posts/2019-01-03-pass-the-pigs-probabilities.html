<p>It’s the holiday season, family is in town, and the board games are out!</p>
<p>At the moment, we have a few games in our main rotation, and oddly enough, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-Games-Pass-Pigs/dp/B00005JG3Y">Pass the Pigs</a> is one of them. It’s a <em>ridiculous</em> game, but after a few rounds, people lock in, the throws get a bit more dramatic, and it actually leads to some good fun.</p>
<p>Pass the Pigs is essentially a dice game, but instead of dice, you throw two little plastic pigs that can land in any number of different ways. Depending on how they land, you score points (or lose points). The first person to reach whatever number you set–usually 100–wins. Consult the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs">Pass the Pigs Wiki</a> page for a full description with rules of the game.</p>
<p>At some point after our first session this Xmas break, I started thinking that it would be fun to look at the probability distributions for scoring points, which seemed like they would be pretty straightforward. The only tricky thing would be to figure out the probabilities for how the pigs landed. Amazingly enough, people have already done some extensive work on this, and there are some good write-ups of probability models and strategies <a href="http://daynebatten.com/2015/09/optimal-pass-the-pigs-strategy/">here</a> <a href="http://paulowengames.blogspot.com/2012/01/risk-management-and-pigs-running.html">and here</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, I took a fairly similar approach to <a href="http://daynebatten.com/2015/09/optimal-pass-the-pigs-strategy/">Dayne Batten</a> in his blogpost on this game, but I still had fun working through all the calculations myself, so here it is!</p>
<div id="pig-probabilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Pig probabilities</h2>
<p>The most difficult part of modeling this game is figuring out the probabilities for how each pig can land. Quickly scanning the internet, I saw different numbers <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/708103/serious-stats-silly-game">here</a> and <a href="http://passpigs.tripod.com/prob.html">here</a>, but in the end, I just went with what is listed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs#Relative_frequencies">Wikipedia page</a>, as it was taken from an <a href="http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/datasets.kern.html">academic paper</a> that seemed to have this most rigorous approach to figuring this out.</p>
<p>Knowing the relative frequencies for the single pig rolls (i.e. the marginal probabilities), we can quickly calculate the joint probabilities from there:</p>
<pre><code>##                 dot    no_dot razorback   trotter  snouter     jowler
## dot       0.1218010 0.1053980 0.0781760 0.0307120 0.010470 0.00212890
## no_dot    0.1053980 0.0912040 0.0676480 0.0265760 0.009060 0.00184220
## razorback 0.0781760 0.0676480 0.0501760 0.0197120 0.006720 0.00136640
## trotter   0.0307120 0.0265760 0.0197120 0.0077440 0.002640 0.00053680
## snouter   0.0104700 0.0090600 0.0067200 0.0026400 0.000900 0.00018300
## jowler    0.0021289 0.0018422 0.0013664 0.0005368 0.000183 0.00003721</code></pre>
<p>As a quick sanity check, we know that all of these probabilities should sum up to one, which we can quickly verify:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(P)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9982008</code></pre>

<h2>Scoring points as a random variable</h2>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-03-pass-the-pigs-probabilities_files/pass_pigs_pts.jpg" />
For every roll of the two pigs, players are awarded points according to how the pigs land as illustrated in the image above.</p>
<p>We can summarize all of the different point outcomes in a table as follows:</p>
<pre><code>##           dot no_dot razorback trotter snouter jowler
## dot         1      0         5       5      10     15
## no_dot      0      1         5       5      10     15
## razorback   5      5        20      10      15     20
## trotter     5      5        10      20      15     20
## snouter    10     10        15      15      40     25
## jowler     15     15        20      20      25     60</code></pre>
<p>The different point outcomes for each roll of the two pigs is also, therefore, a random variable that can take on any of nine different values (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 40, 60).</p>
<p>So for each turn, every time we roll the two pigs, we can think of the points we get a random variable, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, which takes on one of the nine values, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, with a probability equal to the sum of the probabilities of all the different pig combinations that results in that point total:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
p(Z=0) =&amp; \,p(\text{dot, no_dot}) + p(\text{no_dot, dot}) \\
p(Z=1) =&amp; \,p(\text{dot, dot}) + p(\text{no_dot, no_dot}) \\
p(Z=5) =&amp; \,p(\text{razorback, dot}) + p(\text{trotter, dot}) + p(\text{razorback, no_dot}) + p(\text{trotter, no_dot}) + \\
  &amp;p(\text{dot, razorback}) + p(\text{no_dot, razorback}) + p(\text{dot, trotter}) + p(\text{no_dot, trotter}) \\
p(Z=10) =&amp; \,p(\text{snouter, dot}) + p(\text{snouter, no_dot}) + p(\text{trotter, razorback}) + p(\text{razorback, trotter}) + \\
  &amp;p(\text{dot, snouter}) + p(\text{no_dot, snouter}) \\
p(Z=15) =&amp; \,p(\text{jowler, dot}) + p(\text{jowler, no_dot}) + p(\text{snouter, razorback}) + p(\text{snouter, trotter}) + \\
  &amp;p(\text{razorback, snouter}) + p(\text{trotter, snouter}) + p(\text{dot, jowler}) + p(\text{no_dot, jowler})\\
p(Z=20) =&amp; \,p(\text{razorback, razorback}) + p(\text{jowler, razorback}) + p(\text{trotter, trotter}) +p(\text{jowler, trotter}) + \\
  &amp;p(\text{razorback, jowler}) + p(\text{trotter, jowler}) \\
p(Z=25) =&amp; \,p(\text{jowler, snouter}) + p(\text{snouter, jowler}) \\
p(Z=40) =&amp; \,p(\text{snouter, snouter}) \\
p(Z=60) =&amp; \,p(\text{jowler, jowler})
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we can express the full PMF of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    p_Z(z)=
    \begin{cases}
      0.210796, &amp; \text{if}\ z=0 \\
      0.213005, &amp; \text{if}\ z=1 \\
      0.406224, &amp; \text{if}\ z=5 \\
      0.078484, &amp; \text{if}\ z=10 \\
      0.0266622, &amp; \text{if}\ z=15 \\
      0.0617264, &amp; \text{if}\ z=20 \\
      3.66\times 10^{-4}, &amp; \text{if}\ z=25 \\
      9\times 10^{-4}, &amp; \text{if}\ z=40 \\
      3.721\times 10^{-5}, &amp; \text{if}\ z=60 \\
      0, &amp; \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}\]</span></p>

<div id="expected-value-and-pass-the-pigs-strategy" class="section level2">
<h2>Expected value and Pass the Pigs strategy</h2>
<p>The expected value <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the mean point outcome we should get for each roll of our pigs, which we can calculate by summing all of the different point outcomes multiplied by their respective probabilities:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
E[Z] &amp;= \sum z p_Z(z) \\
  &amp;= 0\cdot p(Z=0) + 1\cdot p(Z=1) + \dots 60\cdot p(Z=60)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<pre><code>## [1] 4.719556</code></pre>
<p>Assuming this is our first roll of the game and we are starting with zero points, the expected value would be, <span class="math inline">\(E[Z]\)</span>= 4.719556.</p>
<div id="strategy" class="section level3">
<h3>Strategy!</h3>
<p>The key to Pass the Pigs is knowing when to keep rolling to get more points and knowing when to stop and keep the points you’ve accumulated during your turn before you “pig out” and go back to zero. What is important to keep in mind is that rolling a “pig out”–that is, some combination of pigs that gives you zero points–is not so much being awarded zero points, as it is having all the points you’ve accumulated during your turn taken away from you.</p>
<p>In other words, if <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the total points you’ve been accumulating over all the rolls during your turn, then rolling a “pig out” at probability <span class="math inline">\(p(Z=0)\)</span> gives you <span class="math inline">\(-t\)</span> points.</p>
<p>Going back to our expected value calculation with this information, we now have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
E[Z] &amp;= \sum z p_Z(z) \\
  &amp;= -t\cdot p(Z=0) + 1\cdot p(Z=1) + \dots 60\cdot p(Z=60)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Given our formula now involves the variable <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, our expected value for each roll of the pigs will be different depending on what our current point total <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is. We can easily see this when we plot the expected value function for different <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> values. Here, let’s have a look at what happens to our expected value for each roll of the pigs for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> values ranging from 0 to 100:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-03-pass-the-pigs-probabilities_files/figure-html/create%20vectors%20for%20t%20values%20and%20expected%20values%20then%20plot-1.png" width="672" />
As you can see in the graph, when our starting point total (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) is low, our expected value–i.e. the points we would expect to receive after rolling–is positive. However, as our starting point total (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) increases, the points we would expect after each roll starts to decrease, and in fact, becomes negative after a certain threshold. I’ve already added that point threshold to the above plot (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>= 22.39), but we can solve for this value algebraically, by taking our expected value formula from before, setting it equal to zero and solving for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
t &amp;= \frac{1\cdot p(Z=1) + \dots + 60\cdot p(Z=60)}{p(Z=0)}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>This gives us <span class="math inline">\(t =\)</span> 22.3892104</p>
<p>In other words, until we hit 22.3892104 points, we can still expect to receive a positive value on our next roll. After we hit 22.3892104 for each additional role, our expected value is negative, meaning we would expect to lose all our points by “pigging out”.</p>
<p>I haven’t actually had the chance to try out this strategy yet, but it seems to make sense, even though it might make for very boring game play. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to enjoying my holiday time. Let the games continue!</p>
